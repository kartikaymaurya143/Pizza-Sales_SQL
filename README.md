# Pizza-Sales_SQL
This SQL project focusing on pizza sales data analysis! üçïüìä In this project, I collected and cleaned the data, then extracted valuable insights from a large dataset to help drive business growth. I utilized a range of SQL commands, from basic to advanced, including joins, aggregate functions, GROUP BY, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses.

Upon completion, I compiled all queries into a PowerPoint presentation, showcasing both my technical and presentation skills. This project has significantly enhanced my data analysis capabilities and reinforced my passion for leveraging data to make informed decisions.
